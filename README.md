**`Figma (Product designer|Socail Media Manager|Commmunity Manager)`**

I'm a Nigerian product designer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All design projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with Figma. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. 

## What I do
I create user-centered designs by understanding business requirements, and user feedback<br>
I Create user flows, wireframes, prototypes and mockups<br>
I Translate requirements into style guides, design systems, design patterns and attractive user interfaces<br>
I design UI elements such as input controls, navigational components and informational components<br>
I create original graphic designs (e.g. images, sketches and tables)<br>
I Identify and troubleshoot UX problems (e.g. responsiveness)<br>
I collaborate effectively with product, engineering, and management teams<br>
I Incorporate customer feedback, usage metrics, and usability findings into design in order to enhance user experience<br>

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Jide's Design Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my designer journey as a naive computer science enthusiast with a passion to learn everything I could about this tech world. And all the while, teaching myself html, css and adobe xd development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in FIGMA. A desire that landed me a UI/UX designer job upon graduation.
